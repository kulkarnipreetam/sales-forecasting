# 📈 Forecasting Sales

The goal of this Kaggle project/competition is to develop a machine learning model to **predict the sales** of 33 product families across 54 stores for the period from **August 16 to 30, 2017**. The training dataset comprises **3 million transactions** spanning from January 1, 2013 to August 15, 2017. In addition to this data, supplementary information on **holidays 🏖️** and **oil prices ⛽** during this period is also provided.

### 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis

- 📊 Recognized product families that experience a significant annual sales spike around the New Year
- 📈 Detected periods with maximum sales variation to understand seasonality, using periodogram analysis
- 🔁 Utilized autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation plots to identify relevant lags for improving the forecasting model

---

### 🧠 Modeling

Multivariate linear regression, neural network 🤖, and XGBoost 🌲 models were trained on the dataset.

- For the **multivariate regression** model, trend and seasonal features generated through a deterministic process were incorporated, along with holiday and New Year indicators 🎉. This model was fitted for each combination of the 54 stores and 33 product families, resulting in a total of **1,782 models**.

- In contrast, the **neural network** and **XGBoost** models utilized a different set of features: week number, daily oil prices ⛽, day of the week 📅, holiday indicator 🏖️, New Year indicator 🎉, product family 🛍️, number of products on promotion 🏷️, and store number 🏬.

The models were trained using data from **January 1, 2016, to August 15, 2017**.

### ✅ Results

- XGBoost and multivariate linear regression models demonstrated slightly stronger performance, achieving **R² scores of approximately 91%**.
- The neural network model achieved an **R² of 89%**.
- Incorporating **lag features ⏱️** could potentially improve model accuracy further.
